- Explore the geographic distribution of parks and recreation centres across FSAs.
- Filter and interact with datasets for planning or research purposes.
- Visualize spatial relationships using real Toronto data.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main interface for interacting with the map.
- `script.js` — JavaScript logic for loading data, rendering the map, and applying filters.
- `styles.css` — Basic styling for UI elements.
- `fsa_centroids.json` — Contains FSA centroid coordinates for mapping.
- `Parks and Recreation Facilities - 416 dataset` — Source data containing locations of parks and recreation centres.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Leaflet.js (or other JS mapping library, if applicable)
- GeoJSON for spatial data
- GitHub Pages for static deployment

## ✅ Use Cases

- Civic tech applications for local engagement.
- Urban planning and park accessibility assessments.
- Educational tools for geography and data visualization.
